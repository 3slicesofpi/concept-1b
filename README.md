# Velvet Glove Iron Fist -- Summoning Singapore Reimagined -- Concept-1b
version-control/handling for concept-1b (Summoning-Singapore-Reimagined)

Saved from nuclear annhilation, the Republic of Singapore was transported into another world. Cut off from supply, this nation must deal with problems from within and without as it struggles to secure resources and establish itself on an unfriendly global landscape. Will this nascent nation successfully rely on its talent and technology to survive in this unforgiving world or succumb to a slow, steady decay?

## What's this?

This is a fantasy-scifi novel based around the concept of country level isekai. Plot is primarily based around the light novel/manga Summoning Japan (with major alterations) but with a focus on the diplomacy and worldbuilding, of which I think is absent from the original works.

Plot will be split into four major parts (called Arcs, but theyre not actually arcs. This is a project that begun in the late 2020s, and confusing stuff like this is only the tip of the iceberg) exploring how the embattled nation of Singapore handles dimplomacy with technologically inferior nations, uses its sparse resources to feed an unstable population and defend against any  who threheaten its interests , territory and people. 

Not only that, this novel will also seek to explore the various perspectives of the people, from outside observers, the natives of the land , to the people of Singapore itself, and how they cope with crippling economic depression and the ravages of war. (of atomic scale) 

## Why Github?

#### Leveraging Github's fork system 

Github is used here for version control and comparison.

Here, I can try out multiple ideas at once and choose whichever best fits the storyline. 

Additionally, contributors will find it much easier to help: open a pull request and discuss changes and additions. Helping someone ~~code~~ write has never been easier!

#### Automation

Has potential to improve writing efficiency tenfold. 

anyway...how do you 'git commit' on Word again?

#### Streamline contributor commit procedure.
Help out by commenting your opinions, pointing out flaws or suggesting new additions! Github excels at developer-contributor interaction facilitation so you too can commit. 

#### Learning the damn thing

Github has an expansive set of tools. Hopefully this project will let me discover some of these for myself! (hereby making this project a little less useless.) With every commit, I take one step closer to mastering this complicated website called Github.

English is a language after all.
