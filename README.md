version-control/handling for concept-1b (Summoning-Singapore-Reimagined)

A 4 part story. 
After being saved from total nuclear annhilation, the Republic of Singapore and its citizens find themselves transported into a new world. They must find new allies, extract resources and assert their sovereignty while fending off provocations by rivals and enemies from within and without. The old world was a frightful place, and this world seeks to be no different.
