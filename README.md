# Summoning Singapore Reimagined -- Concept-1b
version-control/handling for concept-1b (Summoning-Singapore-Reimagined)

A 4 part story. 
After being saved from total nuclear annhilation, the Republic of Singapore and its citizens find themselves transported into a new world. They must find new allies, extract resources and assert their sovereignty while fending off provocations by rivals and enemies from within and without. The old world was a frightful place, and this world seeks to be no different.  

## Main Targets

#### Spiralling Into Authoritarianism

As the Republic of Singapore struggles to address teething problems and assert its soverignty in a sea of hostile nations, increasingly dictatorial methods have to be used. The rights of the individual must be sacrificed for the greater good. 

- Show the increasingly harsh measures Government takes to address problems (Food Problems: Military Force, Colonialism) (Protests: Curfew, shoots)
- Erosion of democratic values in the government. Many democratic processes are skipped entirely (Technology Outflow Act)
- The Constitution is ignored most of the time (Emergency Measures Act, passed during WW)
- Finally, total ignorance of the will of the people: (Continued research into deadly bacteria)

#### No Way Home

## Why Github?

#### Leveraging Github's fork system 

Github is used here for version control and comparison.

Here, I can try out multiple ideas at once and choose whichever best fits the storyline. 

Additionally, contributors will find it much easier to help: open a pull request and discuss changes and additions. Helping someone ~~code~~ write has never been easier!

#### Automation

Has potential to improve writing efficiency tenfold. 

anyway...how do you 'git commit' on Word again?

#### Streamline contributor commit procedure.
Help out by commenting your opinions, pointing out flaws or suggesting new additions! Github excels at developer-contributor interaction facilitation so you too can commit. 

#### Learning the damn thing

Github has an expansive set of tools. Hopefully this project will let me discover some of these for myself! (hereby making this project a little less useless.) With every commit, I take one step closer to mastering this complicated website called Github.

English is a language after all.
