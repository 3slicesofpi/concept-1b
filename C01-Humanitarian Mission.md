###### 1 Section 1 

The warm East African sea was uncharacteristically calm today. Light waves lapped at the crumbling dock of Hobyo, slowly eroding the bare rock. A perfect day for swimming, thought Emmet as he stared blankly into the sea. 

‘Oi! Lazy-bum, stop lazing around and get back to work!’ screamed a supervisor, forcing Emmet off the cool sanctuary of the shelter tent back into the hot sun and, to Emmet’s dismay, the ‘loving’ embrace of his supervisor. 

“Heave, Ho! Heave, Ho!” A dozen workers pulled the heavy plastic tarp while others scrambled to fasten it to the steel frame in one last collective burst of energy. Once that was done, everyone retreated into the side-lines, allowing the technicians to populate the tents they just built with medical equipment. Emmet joined his friends in a small, sheltered tent, where his supervisor was handing out chilled drinks. ‘Thanks to your work today, we managed to set everything up ahead of schedule’ He beamed. ‘Take a break, lads, you’ve deserved it.’ Wrenching open the cap, Emmet downed it eagerly. The ice-cold water cooled down his exhausted and overheated body, filling him with a sensation for relaxation.

 Stretching his legs, he turned away from the rest of his friends to face the sea. With his legs sprawled out towards the sand, he watched the beautiful sunset.
 
But this moment of peace would not last for long. The crack of distant gunshots soon filled the air, followed closely by the hollering of orders. A squad of soldiers hurried past the tent, prompting nervous looks. 

‘I hear that the fighting is spreading northward’ quipped a thin balding middle-aged man, referring to the civil war happening around Mogadishu. ‘They’ve exhausted their supplies down south and are raiding for food here.’ 

‘Could we be the target?’ Emmet asked. ‘Ha!’ A different man replied, ‘We have ships and they don’t! If they dare try, the Peashooter will make short work of ‘em!’ As if to reinforce his message, the ‘Peashooter’, a 76mm naval gun roared into life, its angular body turning to face the enemy. Boom! The monstrous sound of the gun firing shook even the metal structure of the tents. Emmet instinctively raised his hands to his ears and squeezed his eyes shut. 

###### 1 Section 1.5 (Filler)

When Emmet finally mustered enough courage to open his eyes, the gunshots had all but ceased. The ‘Peashooter’ had scared them away! Everyone cheered and laughed. Emmet just breathed a sigh of relief.  

“Watch out below!” The heavy steel container slammed onto the bare rock, throwing a thick cloud of dust. Emmet hacked and coughed as he approached the unloading area. A big load of cardboard boxes was dropped onto his arms by a smug-looking man. One of the reasons for his happiness could be clearly seen; with the massive bulk of the container ship ‘CS-Saus 8’ offering shade and shelter against the burning African heat.

As he trundled down the narrow stone dock, his attention was diverted toward the massive crowd of scraggy and dishevelled refugees at the perimeter surrounding the port. Even from a distance, Emmet could clearly see their desperation and hunger. Only the watchful gaze of armed soldiers deterred them from charging past the chain-link perimeter fence and taking the supplies of food. 

Inside the refugee camp, Emmet could smell the stink of fear and uncertainty emanating from the refugees around him. A few children noticed him passing through and ran to the fence, their bony hands rattling the fence in anguish as they begged for food. At least they are safe now, Emmet thought, trying to reassure himself.

Long lines were formed outside the kitchen, with each person clutching a bowl in their hands, waiting for their turn to be served. With food just minutes away, the refugees had calmed down somewhat and were waiting patiently for their food. Inside the kitchen however, it was absolute chaos. The chefs scrambled around the room, trying to cook. Steam emanated from dozens of heavy pots while the hurried clop-clop-clop of knives against chopping blocks could be heard above the chaos. Curious, Emmet peeked inside one of the pots. It was a grey viscous goop with a curious smell. Quickly, he replaced the lid, opting to conserve his appetite.

“Tastes delicious, doesn’t it? It’ll be what we’re gonna serve you if yer’ don’t behave ‘round these pots.” a haggard looking but no less energetic woman came up to him, waving her ladle at Emmet threateningly.

“You’re the delivery guy, right? Thanks fer’ yer’ help, we were going to run out of slop. I was wondering what to say to the customers with nothin’ to serve” she smiled, taking the packages from Emmet’s hands and expertly manoeuvring them out of the kitchen.

“Next time, tell the boys not to walk through here, all right? You can’t keep clogging up the kitchen like that, or the boss’ll complain. Ya’ hear me?” But Emmet was too distracted, dreamily following behind her.

“Do go back and help me fetch another crate, remind them to load it up with something edible this time, I ain’t serving up crap.” A bottle of chilled water was suddenly shoved into Emmet’s arms, shaking him out of his imagination. “Thanks fer’ coming.” This statement put him right back into dreamland. 

A victorious Emmet carried the water like a bottle of wine to the ship to relish every last drop. 

###### 1 Section 2 

That evening, Emmet noticed the usually boisterous canteen was nearly silent; its denizens were glued to a television broadcast at the corner of the room.

“…As the famine in East Africa worsens, the civil war rages on. With their dwindling supplies stretched thin, the armed groups have resorted to looting to keep the war going. We now turn to our correspondent in Africa for more details.” 

The screen turned to an exhausted looking man in a dusty suit and tie. 

“Right, Bob, I’ve been to a few battlefields before but never have I seen one this awful. What started as a localized power struggle has transformed into a desperate battle for food as crops all around the region succumb to a new deadly disease.”

With a gloved hand, he raised a wilted wheat plant to the camera. It was a disgusting colour of brown with boils all over its thin stem. The entire canteen was also watching the news broadcast with Emmet and were horrified when they saw it. A few vomited upon seeing the plant. 

“Viewer discretion is advised.”, continued the correspondent, oblivious to the carnage he had just caused. 

“The virus is spreading rapidly throughout the continent. Despite large-scale efforts by the nascent African Union to slow its spread, this deadly disease has not slowed down.”

“Thank goodness we all we eat are vat-grown food!” exclaimed someone, breaking the silence and prompting a humoured response from the canteen. But Emmet was unconvinced, worriedly looking out towards the sea of tents that made up the refugee camp, then to the shifting sands beyond.

## ACT 2

“The Endurance-300 Landing Platform Dock is suited for both combat and humanitarian missions. Its expansive hangars can carry aircraft to defend the fleet or accommodate thousands of refugees.

###### 2 Section 1

There was a palpable sense of dread in the air. The volunteers sat in their benches nervously, waiting for something to happen. They had been called up to the canteen, some of whom had been pulled out of jobs or, in the night shift volunteers’ case, abruptly jolted out from their afternoon nap. 

Finally, an important looking person clambered onto a bench and turned to address the crowd. 

Supervisor: Good morning, everyone. I have some difficult news to share with you all. Due to the worsening situation on the ground, we have decided to… call off the mission early.

This was immediately met by a chorus of shocked cries and sighs of relief. Tens of voices rose above the rising background discussion, fighting for attention. “Could we have some silence please?” yelled the man before turning to let a concerned volunteer speak. 

“What does that mean for the refugees? Are we just going to leave them stranded here?”

“I understand how you feel, and I appreciate your commitment to helping others. Unfortunately, given the current situation, there isn't much we can do right now. The situation has become increasingly dangerous and will inhibit operations here and threaten our safety. We cannot let anyone get in harm’s way.” There were a few nods of agreement. 

“This is so frustrating. We came here to help people, and now we have to leave before we can do anything. What can we do to help the refugees even though we must leave?”

“Given the current situation, there isn't much we can do right now. However, we can continue to raise awareness about the situation in this region and the need for continued support and assistance.”

Everyone groaned. “Raising awareness! When has that ever worked out!”

“That is all we have time for today. You will be updated on your new duties later, thank you.” He said, while waving away further questions from the volunteers.

###### 2 Section 2

Under the devastating heat of the arc-cutter, the support pole broke in two and clattered to the floor, with a searing white-hot glow. Freed from its shackles, Emmet was able to pull the computer terminal out from its mountings and onto a large pile of stuff at the mouth of the tent. Fatigued from working non-stop for nearly four hours, Emmet took his first break since getting his duties this morning, plopping down on a bench. 
Oh, the irony, he thought. Only last week was I setting up these tents. Now I’ll have to tear them down again. 
A technician frantically ran past his tent, trying to save his precious equipment from being destroyed.  Their medical workbenches and computers were being ripped out of their fittings one by one to save time, much to their horror. Emmet could not resist chuckling at the absurdity of the situation.
Emmet turned to the last appliance left in the tent, a small lab fridge. Its original contents had long since been cleared out. However, a single item remained inside its clear glass door. Emmet reached inside and retrieved a bottle of water, still chilled from the cold air left in the fridge--- A reward from the gods to thank him for his work.
But before he could even take a sip, the chatter of gunshots jolted him out of his trance, reminding Emmet about the urgent situation outside. Back to work.
