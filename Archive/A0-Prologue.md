### Arc 0 Planning
# Prologue

Details about Earth's cities being blown up by nukes
say something about the failure of diplomacy
say something about how military force also failed to achieve results; on the contary, it damned its users to nuclear annhilation

#### Stage 1 Setting the Scene

- Flattened cities and battered buildings
- Total, complete and utter destruction
- Nukes flying EVERYWHERE

#### Stage 2 Plot Progression

- Chinese (at this point, dont tell them; make it ambiguous) intelligence finds out that a battered US fleet has retreated to Singapore
- They launch a nuke to finish it off. (again, ambigious but clearly its in Siberia. Maybe Chinese-controlled Russian nuke operators)
- Singapore's residents helplessly watch as an incoming nuke approaches their country
- A red ball 'eats up' the nuke, then engulfs the entire island in a massive storm.
- The Republic of Singapore, USN 9th Fleet remnants and a large number of refugee and cargo ships are tranported to Elysia, the New World.
