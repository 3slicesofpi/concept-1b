### Arc 1 Planning
# A Search for Allies

#### Though Arc A2-Mariai occurs first, A1 will have priority to establish worldbuilding.
## Desired Outcomes (Reader):
- Understand the economic and social situation in Singapore.
- A top-down view of Qua-Toyne's military woes.
- Basic character development for Gennesone, who is stressed and worried and considers the trade deal to be his only hope; he is determined to see it succeed.
- Begin transition of Singapore civilian govt to military led govt. (start only)
- Introduce Qua-Toyne religion
- Finally, establish the technological disparity between the two nations.
#### Character Focus: Foreign Affairs Commissioner Beyn of the Principality (Beyn), Foreign Minister Gensonne of the Republic of Singapore (Gens)

## Desired Outcomes (Plot):
- First Contact between Singapore and Qua-Toyne, focusing on Qua-Toyne perspective
- Qua-Toyne liaison is invited onto the shores of Singapore.
- Members of liaison become mildly suspicious of govt efforts to hide information from them. (TV programmes being cut off, loud but distant explosions)
- Finally, Sign Trade deal: military aid and security guarntees in exchange for Qua-Toyne's plentiful food.

- Establish that the reduction and subsequent ceasing of overseas imports have hurt the economy; vending machines sit empty.
- There is a large number of refugees fleeing warzones in Singapore. Big social impact. Minor protests for now.
- There is a rising fear that can be felt in the tense atmosphere.
 
## Outline:
- QT(Beyn) is informed of the first contact incident during a council meeting about the war. 
- Beyn meets Gensonne at Maihark Port. Beyn visits the docked frigate as both await a helicopter to take them back.
- Beyn marvels at the massive frigate and the helicopter but his appearnce betrays no feeling at all, much to the worry of Gensonne (this will be the set-up for future tension)
- Beyn and his liaison is chucked into a hotel as the nation (SG) makes preparations to formally recieve the QT liasion.
- Genesonne sees Qt as a potential source of food to keep population from starving.
- As he writes the trade deal paper, he realises that Singapore has nothing to export and will expoerience severe deficit.
- Gensonne's friend and colleague in military suggests exporting security in exchange for food supply (subtext: use military force and make them a protectorate)
- Gensonne does not agree with this (he prefers a mutual defence compact) but agrees anyways.
- Beyn and liaison is shown a military parade.
