todo: prettify this mess

Overview:
Cultivation is a technique the people of Elysia use to use and manipulate magic using their own bodies. With their blood as conduits and organs as catalysts, mages can use magic to cast complex spells or harness its medicinal properties to heal and fix, or even improve oneself.

Basic History:
Cultivation was popularized during the War Against the Divines as once-proud nations were defeated by the Ravernals and had to fight guerilla wars as small sects. As equipping and training legions of soldiers was no longer feasible, these sects instead pored their resources into supporting the cultivation of a few individuals (with support from the Divines) to create powerful mages.
Carrying out raids and partisan attacks against the Ravernal backline and industry, evem the relentless Ravernal tide had to relent, stopping completely at times to root out rebels and dissenters.
Cultivation was further popularized when the Heroes, summoned from other realties to defeat the Ravernals, spread their own knowledge of cultivation around the world as they traveled.
After the Banishing, the Divines united all the disparate sects into a single Confederation, a nation of holy peace and harmony. Under their divine rule, a new era of trade and prosperity began. Most importantly however, secrets and techniques of cultivation could be spread all around the continent, allowing mages to cultivate faster.

Comparison to Magic Formations:
The bodies of a cultivator can be seen as a magic formation, with sources, conduits and catalysts. However, the main difference is that cultivators can alter the flow of mana in their bodies, hence creating different 'magic formations' in their bodies.
    
    Sources:

        Skin: (absorption)
        The skin is able to break down manacules and repackage the mana in artificial manacules, which can be transported in the bloodstream and can be used directly by catalysts.
        Most cultivators (even proficient mages) use passive collection to passively absorb manacules from the surroundings, leveraging the fact that manacules will be attracted to mana expenditure events already occuring in their body, to generate atmospheric currents, funneling more mana towards the mage. This method is simple yet powerful, only limited by the magnitude of mana expenditure events in their body. 
        It also has significant ramp-up time, whereby the mage has to slowly increase the magnitude of mana expenditure event (slowly cast the spell) as manacule flow slowly increases.

        Skin: (Active Collection)
        Some cultivators choose to jumpstart mana collection by maintaining a fast mana absorption event. A simple purposeless manaic event (such as boiling water) is used to quickly attract a large amount of manacules for the main spell. This method is fast and is favoured by guards who need to unleash their power quickly in reaction to an assailant.
        However, this method requires the mage to master the art of conduit switching effectively.

        Batteries
        Some cultivators do away with the hassle of ramp-up completely and (though a variety of means) 'form' a reserve of mana within their bodies. This allows mages to cast big spells despite low mana production, using mana from batteries to make up the difference. 
        The disadvantage of this method is that unethical and dangerous methods must be used to create batteries as they cannot form naturally in human and elven bodies.

    Conduits:

        Blood:
        Some animals (including elves and certain humans) have blood that can carry artificial manacules. The manacules can bond to their blood cells readily and leave just as easily at their destination, making for a efficient method to transport mana though an animal's body.

        Risks (and Explosion Events):
        Great care must be taken to prevent manacules from the environment from entering the bloodstream as they will bond to blood cells in place of regular manacules and cannot be seperated. (think carbon monoxide poisoning)
        This often occurs when mages try to absorb more manacules than their skin can deal with, allowing natural manacules to seep though and enter the bloodstream. This is especially common with mages who use batteries as the skin cannot cope with big spikes in mana absorption rates.  

        If too many manacules are present in the bloodstream, the artifical manacules may react with each other (or even natural manacules permanently bonded to blood cells) creating a small explosion within the bloodstream.
        With large enough amounts of mana, a runaway chain reaction can occur where all the mana in the bloodstream reacts, causing a massive explosion, which is often fatal.

        Though the defining characteristic of cultivation is the ability to alter mana flow on the fly, many mages find it difficult to do that when manaic current is high (such as when they are in the middle of casting a spell.) 
        Attempting to do so without the proper technique may result in the aforementioned event (unintentional runaway reactions in your heart and blood) or even manacule-laden blood cells refusing to follow instructions and simply barreling towards the main mana expediture event, creating a giant hole in the body.
