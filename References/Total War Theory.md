# Total War Theory
The Total War Theory is a document written by Manson Au (The Hegemon) about the economic methods of fighting in an all out war.

It consists of two main parts; a short but informative manifesto and an extensive and detailed set of instructions. 

**Part I** elaborates on the definitions of conflict, and its various stages of escalation, explores the ethics and practicalities surrounding total war and gives a general overview on the various techniques to mobilize an economy for an industrialized war, giving various examples from the USA, USSR and Korea. It is meant to be a hybrid manifesto-thesis.

**Part II** gives highly specific instructions on how to mobilize a nation for war, explains the techniques to sustain an industrial war and most importantly, the economic, social and political initiatives that must be implemented. It was written after Manson was Transferred and became the Hegemon of the Republic. His associates recount that the Hegemon wrote it in preparation of a major war with the Holy Empire. 

The following is a crude summary of both parts of the Total War Theory. 

Disclaimer: _This may look like the crude ravings of a madman (and have all the hallmarks of a failed thesis). This is intentional and is used to portray Manson's views and character._

## An Argument For Total War
Many people, justfiably, view war and conflict as abhorrent and abominable. It is a catastophic waste of life and material that could be better spent on uplifting the human race and improving quality of life for all. However, as irrational thought almost always trumps practical considerations in the apex of government, one must begrudgingly accept the constancy of war. 

While one cannot prevent conflict entirely, it is possible to shorten the war and reduce losses by devoting the maximum amount of resources to the cause. While this may sound paradoxical, bringing an overwhelming amount of firepower and men to the field of battle will overpower the enemy, securing victory easily and quickly before too many lives are lost and too much destroyed.

Against a larger enemy, the defending nation must devote the maximum amount of resources it can muster against the aggressor. Though surrender would save the lives of a number of soldiers, folding to an aggressor will only allow him to continue attacking other weaker nations, perpetuating the cycle of conflict whilst leaving the nation in the hands of aggressors.
Conducting total war against a larger enemy, even one with overwhelming force, will cause extensive damage to the enemy, forcing them to rebuild their forces and dissuading their leadership from taking aggressive action. Additionally, allies and third-party observers will be properly forewarned against the threat and can mount an effective defense, thus breaking the cycle of conflict.

As an ally, when going into total war, even while not being attacked directly, will allow the conflict to end as quickly as possible. Allies would recieve military and civilian aid, taking pressure off the beleagured defenders and the struggling people. 

_Summary:_

_The Chapter..._

_Asserts that Total War frees up more resources for use by military forces and civilians._

_States that increased supply of men and material will help shorten the war, ending it as quickly as possible_

_States that going into Total War will dissuade opposing forces from taking further aggressive action, preventng more wars_

## Definitions of Total War

For a nation to fully enter the state of Total War, 

The combined agricultural and industrial might of the nation in its entirety must be marshalled and devoted to the military forces and the government.

All industry not producing essential goods for the people must be altered to produce military equipment. 

The workforce must expand. Unemployed men and women, immigrants and convicts will devote their sweat and toil for the war.

A state of emergency must be issued, where the governmnet will be given maximum flexibility to conduct Total War. vital and important bills and initaitives will be passed under. This state of emergency will last only for the duration of the conflict, and must never be extended beyond it. Short of another Total War, this must never be implemented again. 

Democracy should be inhibited, in part or whole, but only to quicken the implementation of laws, initiatives and bills, and only for the duration of the conflict, and must never be extended beyond that.

To ensure the continued support of the people, the freezing of prices of essential goods, the reduction of inflation, creation of jobs and cooling of home property prices are needed. These plans should be continued indefintely after the war.

To ensure the continued support of the people, the production and dissemination of propaganda for civilian consumption must begin, the spread of information must be controlled and monitored, all dissenters must be neutralized and any foreign influence must be kept to a minimum. These plans should be implemented under the state of emergency and will be repealed after the war is over. These plans should be kept secret from the civilian population.
