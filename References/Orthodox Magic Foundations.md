## Overview
Orthodox magic, an integral part of this world, adheres rigorously to a structured set of principles governing its existence, utilization, and limitations.

Magic revolves around the capture, storage and usage of a powerful energy source, mana.

Mana is used in magic formations to do work.

The state of mana can be altered in a magic formation to do different kinds of work.

## Introduction
The classical understanding of mana is as follows:

(An instance of) Mana is a hybrid energy-particle that exists in a probabilistic limbo between energy and matter. If it is observed, it will collapse and become one of the two.

The probability of how a single mana energy-particle instance will collapse is governed by its three wave-functions: the primary, secondary and tertiary/longitudinal wave-functions, also called the x, y and z axis respectively. _(hurr durr uhh actually the mana instances don't move like waves they spin in two axes and vibrate gugh...)_

If the tertiary wave function collapses when it is positive, the mana will become protons (or something similar), which have a positive charge. On the other hand, if the z-axis is negative, the mana will become neutrons, which have no charge. (Note: the typeof produced matter is governed bt the primary and secondary wave-functions. More on that later)
The greater the magnitude of the function, the more particles are created per instance of mana.

However, any opposing wave functions, even those on different instances, will (try to) cancel out one other. Hence, only one function, the function with the greater total magnitude, will prevail.

The primary and secondary wave functions are much more complicated. The function of these functions are initally vague and unclear when looked at individually but when multiple instances of mana are stringed together in a long chain, each individual instance's x and y axis will interact with each other, forming new mysterious and complicated wave-functions, allowing the mana to take on magical properties.

Magic formations manipulate mana instances' wave functions, then attach the instances together to form strings. The stringifyed mana will then be collapsed in a catalyst, which harness its power to do work.

## Mana Sources

Reality in Elysia is a bubble of calm floating inside an eternity of chaos called the Void. Seperating the two realities is a thin grey edge called a gellar field membrane that prevents the two realities from interacting with each other.

When the gellar field is disturbed, instances of mana and arcana, mana's evil twin, will be formed on either side of the membrane.

Under normal circumstances, mana and arcana will annhilate each other but the edge seperates the two energies, allowing mana to continue existing in reality while arcana can persist in the chaotic Void.

## Manacules

Mana will collapse the moment it is observed. Hence, it is extremely unstable and must be shielded from outside influences in order to exist.

Some strings of mana, given the right wave-function, can enter a stasis state where it exists in perpetual limbo between being alive and in a collapsed state; they are constantly on the verge of collapse.

By wrapping a small amount of low-energy mana in these stasis strings, outside influence cannot penetrate and cause the mana inside to collapse. This is a manacule.

The gellar field membrane is able to form the stasis strings and wrap them around mana, forming manacules.

### Properties of Manacules

The stasis strings have a high net negative charge. Hence, they will be repelled from matter with high positive charge, including other manacules. Conversely, they will be attracted to matter with high negative charge such as electrons.

Manacules will gradually move towards the world of Elysia, as it is attracted to the electrons.

### Harvesting manacules

To release the precious mana inside a manacule, the wrapper surrounding the mana must be removed. One can easily do this by slamming particles with high positive charge, such as protons, high z-axis instances of mana and other, bigger manacules.

When this happens, the stasis strings will all collapse based on their wave functions, forming normal matter.  

The mana contained inside will be released and can be used.

More often than not, the mana inside the manacule will all converge on a single point of the wrapper. If the sum of charge is great enough, the above reaction will occur.
Though the mana will be released, they will probably all collapse immediately afterward due to exposure to outside influences.
