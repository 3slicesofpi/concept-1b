## Overview
Orthodox magic, an integral part of this world, adheres rigorously to a structured set of principles governing its existence, utilization, and limitations.

Magic revolves around the capture, storage and usage of a powerful energy source, mana.

Mana is used in magic formations to do work.

The state of mana can be altered in a magic formation to do different kinds of work.

## Introduction
The classical understanding of mana is as follows:

(An instance of) Mana is a hybrid energy-particle that exists in a probabilistic limbo between energy and matter. If it is observed, it will collapse and become one of the two.

The probability of how a single mana energy-particle instance will collapse is governed by its three wave-functions: the primary, secondary and tertiary/longitudinal wave-functions, also called the x, y and z axis respectively. _(hurr durr uhh actually the mana instances don't move like waves they spin in two axes and vibrate gugh...)_

If the tertiary wave function collapses when it is positive, the mana will become protons (or something similar), which have a positive charge. On the other hand, if the z-axis is negative, the mana will become neutrons, which have no charge. (Note: the typeof produced matter is governed bt the primary and secondary wave-functions. More on that later)
The greater the magnitude of the function, the more particles are created per instance of mana.

However, any opposing wave functions, even those on different instances, will (try to) cancel out one other. Hence, only one function, the function with the greater total magnitude, will prevail.

The primary and secondary wave functions are much more complicated. The function of these functions are initally vague and unclear when looked at individually but when multiple instances of mana are stringed together in a long chain, each individual instance's x and y axis will interact with each other, forming new mysterious and complicated wave-functions, allowing the mana to take on magical properties.

Magic formations manipulate mana instances' wave functions, then attach the instances together to form strings. The stringifyed mana will then be collapsed in a catalyst, which harness its power to do work.

## Mana Sources

Reality in Elysia is a bubble of calm floating inside an eternity of chaos called the Void. Seperating the two realities is a thin grey edge called a gellar field membrane that prevents the two realities from interacting with each other.

When the gellar field is disturbed, instances of mana and arcana, mana's evil twin, will be formed on either side of the membrane.

Under normal circumstances, mana and arcana will annhilate each other but the edge seperates the two energies, allowing mana to continue existing in reality while arcana can persist in the chaotic Void.

## Manacules

Mana will collapse the moment it is observed. Hence, it is extremely unstable and must be shielded from outside influences in order to exist.

Some strings of mana, given the right wave-function, can enter a stasis state where it exists in perpetual limbo between being alive and in a collapsed state; they are constantly on the verge of collapse.

By wrapping a small amount of low-energy mana in these stasis strings, outside influence cannot penetrate and cause the mana inside to collapse. This is a manacule.

The gellar field membrane is able to form the stasis strings and wrap them around mana, forming manacules.

### Properties of Manacules

The stasis strings have a high net negative charge. Hence, they will be repelled from matter with high positive charge, including other manacules. Conversely, they will be attracted to matter with high negative charge such as electrons.

Manacules will gradually move towards the world of Elysia, as it is attracted to the electrons.

### Harvesting manacules

To release the precious mana inside a manacule, the wrapper surrounding the mana must be removed. One can easily do this by slamming particles with high positive charge, such as protons, high z-axis instances of mana and other, bigger manacules.

When this happens, the stasis strings will all collapse based on their wave functions, forming normal matter.  

The mana contained inside will be released and can be used.

More often than not, the mana inside the manacule will all converge on a single point of the wrapper. If the sum of charge is great enough, the above reaction will occur.
Though the mana will be released, they will probably all collapse immediately afterward due to exposure to outside influences.

## Magic Formations

A simple magic formation consists of four components: source(s) of mana, conduits, processors and catalyst(s). 

These are arranged in a specific pattern for the efficient and safe flow and use of mana.

Functional, efficient and safe magic formations are the backbone of any magic-based civilisation.

_Note that 'Magic Formations' here refers to all things underthe above definition, including and not limited to: all magic formations pre- and post- Banishment and Cultivating Mages' bodies._

### Sources of Mana

These components generate the nescessary mana neeeded the power the rest of the formation. Without them, the formation would not have the requisite energy to function.
    
There are two types of sources; batteries (storage) and collectors (production).

#### Rock Sappers/Manastone Sappers

Under the right conditions, mana flowing in the earth can get stuck, creating large concentrations of manacules. Over time, this mana will bond to the surrounding rocks, enriching the rock and creating manastones.

Rock Sappers absorb manacules from manastones by creating a low-density, highly charged area next to the manastone, attracting the manacules and pulling them out of the rock. 

Manastones come in many different varieties and form under different circumstances. Thus, they have varying rarities and manacule density.

The following is a list of manastones compatiable with common charge-type rock sappers.

- **Soil/Top-Level substrate.** Manacules often get stuck here as they come in from outer space. However, manacule concentrations are low as plants and animals absorb the mana in the soil as quickly as they are supplied. The Ravernals used massive dredging machines to collect the manacules from the soil. Their wrecks can still be seen today in frigid northern wastes.

- **Enriched Rocks.** By far the most common type of manastone. Manacules get trapped in these rocks and, with few plants and bacteria to deplete mana, they will continue holding and absorbing manacules for centuries. The deeper the rock is found, and depending of the type of rock, enriched rocks can hold a large amount of mana.

- **Mana Crystals.** Some plants and animals will store some of the mana they collect in their bodies in a mana battery, using it as a form of energy storage to survive Elysia's long and brutal winters. When they die, the crystals will remain. Mana crystals found in the frigid north have high mana capacity but release mana much slower, reflecting their original use for hibernation while mana crystals found under grasslands release mana faster at the cost of capacity as its owners spend their mana on chasing prey.

- **Mana Batteries** When mana-storing plants and animals grow older, their batteries will crystallize and become unable to absorb mana. However, harvesting them from young plants and animals in their prime guaruntees pristine quality and maximum absorption rate. Farms breed apex predators at an industrial scale to produce mana batteries by the ton.

- **Mana Capacitators** Purely artificial designs, mana capacitators are specialized crystals formed in a lab under carefully controlled conditions. They are capable of releasing their entire store of mana in mere moments, making them useful in large, complicated magic formations which require large but momentary mana thoughput such as guns. Mana capacitators are highly expensive due to the high cost of production and lack of supply.

#### Collectors
Collectors are specialized magic formations designed towards the collection of manacules from the surrounding environment to be used in the magic formation.

They are often embedded in the main formation as runes but can exist as standalone magic formations to produce larger amounts of mana. 

Too many collectors in one area can result in the depletion of manacules as they are absorbed faster than they can be replaced. This concern becomes especially relevant with the largest heavy-duty industrial collectors, which can deplete entire regions.

### Conduits for Mana

Once the mana has been removed from the manacules, conduits must deliver the mana to consumers such as catalysts without allowing the mana to collapse while en-route.

- **Wires**
By manipulating a magnetic field within a solid metal block, mana can flow through unimpeded.
A rune may be inserted within the wire to create the magnetic field that causes mana flow.
As wires have to be made of magnetic metals such as iron, they are cast as one solid block.

- **Blood**
Some animals (including elves and certain humans) have blood that can carry artificial manacules. The manacules can bond to their blood cells easily and release mana readily at their destination, making for a efficient method to transport mana though an animal's body.
However, great care must be taken to prevent manacules from the environment from entering the bloodstream as they will bond to blood cells in place of regular manacules and cannot be seperated.

### Processing of Mana

Processors manipulate the wave functions of mana instances and then attach the changed mana together to form long mana strings, which would be used in catalysts to do magic.

Mana processing is one of the most complicated parts of the magic formation as extreme accuracy and precision is needed, while demand for raw throughput is high.

Flux, a product of errant processors producing incomplete or faulty mana-strings can also be formed and must be cleared.

There are different ways of processing mana, each taking varying approaches.

- **Synchrotrons**
Individual processors are lined up on the conduit. They pick up strings from the conduit and add their processed mana instances before returning it to the conduit. Though this is by far the simplest design, requiring only one set of processors and flux scrubbers, synchrotrons require high synchronisation. Mistakes will result in failure. However, if its shortcomings are addressed, synchrotrons can process a massive amount of mana. Most famously used in the Transference Circle.

- **Linear Processing**
A long line of processors, each one attached in front of each other, attach their processed instances to the string one at a time. Inefficient and costly, this method is only used in small mobile applications such as guns.

- **Batch Processing**
A combination of the two. By creating small chunks of strings in linear processors around a conduit, batches of these strings can be attached to form a longer string. Uses logic gates and schedulers to reduce mistakes and improve efficiency.

### Catalysts
The centerpiece of the magic formation. Converts mana strings into work done.
Some catalysts are used in a support role.

There are a huge variety of catalysts, some naturally produced by the ground, some formed inside of plants and animals.

- **Tears**
Named after its eyedrop-like shape, Tears 'grab' onto manacules and pull them towards itself. Pulling bonded manacules will cause the enriched matter to move in the same direction. Used in conjunction with the Longan.
Tears differ in size, lift weight, consumption rate, etc.

- **Longan**
Momentarily forces manacules to bond to matter.
Different longan variants enrich different types of matter. The blue longan enriches water while brown and red longans enriches earth and metal respectively.
Longans differ in enrichment rate, mana consumption rate, etc.

- **Filament**
A thin string or woven cloth. Produces heat. Can emit light if enough heat is produced.

- **Vibrating Sensor Crystal**
When the crystal absorbs light, it will vibrate.
Different sensor variants absorb light at differing frequencies, from radio waves to UV light.

- **Clarifying Lens**
Fuses with other catalysts to give it a range aspect (allows a longan to enrich rocks farther away, rather than the rocks right next to it.)
Many different variants exists, including pure runic crystals and even one made of plant fibre.
