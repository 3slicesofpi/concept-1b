# Orthodox Magic

## Overview
Orthodox magic, an integral part of this world, adheres rigorously to a structured set of principles governing its existence, utilization, and limitations.

Magic revolves around the capture, storage and usage of a powerful energy source, mana.

Mana is used in magic formations to do work.

The state of mana can be altered in a magic formation to do different kinds of work.

## Introduction
The classical understanding of mana is as follows:

(An instance of) Mana is a hybrid energy-particle that exists in a probabilistic limbo between energy and matter. If it is observed, it will collapse and become one of the two.

The probability of how a single mana energy-particle instance will collapse is governed by its three wave-functions: the primary, secondary and tertiary/longitudinal wave-functions, also called the x, y and z axis respectively.

If the tertiary wave function collapses when it is positive, the mana will become protons (or something similar), which have a positive charge. On the other hand, if the z-axis is negative, the mana will become neutrons, which have no charge. (Note: the typeof produced matter is governed bt the primary and secondary wave-functions. More on that later)
The greater the magnitude of the function, the more particles are created per instance of mana.

However, any opposing wave functions, even those on different instances, will (try to) cancel out one other. Hence, only one function, the function with the greater total magnitude, will prevail.

The primary and secondary wave functions are much more complicated. The function of these functions are initally vague and unclear when looked at individually but when multiple instances of mana are stringed together in a long chain, each individual instance's x and y axis will interact with each other, forming new mysterious and complicated wave-functions, allowing the mana to take on magical properties.

Magic formations manipulate mana instances' wave functions, then attach the instances together to form strings, then collapse the resultant string in a catalyst, which harness its power, to do work.
