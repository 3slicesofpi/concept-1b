todo: prettify this mess.

Plot Relevance:
Though all parts of the story (with the exception of the prologue) occur on Elysia, Terra, and the various events that occur on its surface will impact the plot in various ways.

This timeline is not meant to be political, with every effort taken to prevent taking sides. (Except against Russia, because that is based.)

Requirements:
Contributors take note!
The Historical Timeline (Terra) is important as it sets the stage for many vital plot points.

The Timeline succeeds in:
    The fall of the Unipolar World Order
    USA falls from grace and loses its position as the premiere world power on the global stage. China, various European nations (EU) and even Iran will take over USA's place.
    The fall of the Rules-based World Order
    Nations can use a variety of methods to manipulate their opponent's population to act on their behalf. With such powerful tools of covert influence, even regional powers like Iran can become above the law.
    World War Three
    China and the USA eventually clashing. 
    The Second Cold War, with all the proxy battles are simply a lead-up to all of this. Yes, twenty years was indeed needed to ignite a war between to global powers.
    Singapore getting Nuked
    An Ohio-Class SSBN, despite being wounded, still presents a credible threat to ANY nuclear force. Hypersonics were used to deliver the deadly nuclear payload.
    Putin Getting What He Deserves (Optional)
    Just a personal one from the author. What's there to love about an ex-KGB agent and his oligarch cronies?

Suggestions must take these requiremnts into account before they will be considered for inclusion. You can feel free to include your own political agenda / beliefs inside (as long as they aren't too radical) your contributions and diss me with your superior storytelling and knowledge of geopolitics. 
Why, Yes, a timeline where both Russia and China emerges victorious over USA and its puppets in the EU can be included in the story so long as the 9th Fleet and a SSBN somehow gets stuck in Tuas, and are both nuked by a hypersonic missile.

2022: Russian Invasion of Ukraine. 
Despite initial setbacks, the Ukrainians successfully manage to push the Russians back and achieve a stalemate. Russia will devote immense resources to this war, pouring massive amounts of money and men in attempt after fruitless attempt to retake the initiative and end the war once and for all.
2023: Gaza Crisis. 
the Middle East becomes unstable once again after a short period of relative peace. Hamas militants attack Isreal in an all-out war. Isreal responds with relentless force, blockading the Gaza Strip, bombing the militants and arresting droves of Palestinians. Each side trades accusations of warcrimes and human rights violations. In the wider region, insurrectionists and militants rise up in support for Hamas' fight against Isreal and the West, launching attacks against assets linked to Isreal, including cargo ships.
The United States forms a coalition to protect global shipping near the Horn of Africa, shooting down missiles launched by militants.
Later on, the US becomes frustrated at Isreal's heavy-handed approach to dealing with Hamas, complaining about excess casualties. When Isreal refused to back down and placed even more pressure on innocent Palestinians instead, the US withdraws much of its military aid for Isreal.
Russia finally realises that it cannot gain anything from fighting in the war. Therefore, it opts to fight using alternative means.
To undermine the credibility of its opponent, Russia leverages its army of bots and trolls and a sophisticated network of influencers and agents to thoroughly saturate the internet with propaganda. Constant reminders of the West's previous follies fill social media while forums and blogs become indunated with praise for Putin. All over Youtube and Reddit, talking heads curse and swear at the incumbents, pointing at minor errors and mistakes to justify their shaky narratives while espousing the opposition for supporting vague and backward ideals. In the halls of the European Union, Russian supporters stall and veto every piece of legislature, slowing bureaucracy to a grinding halt. With such varied and far-reaching attacks on the West, their resolve crumbles. 
2024: During the 2024 Elections, thanks to Russian propaganda, the opposition wins and a radical president is elected. He immediately brings in a slew of isolationist policies, cutting America off from the outside world. He also withdraws all support for Isreal and Ukraine and reverses many of the efforts made by the previous administration. 
2025: The US' economy is heavily reliant on exporting and importing goods from all around the world. The administration's isolationist policies have sabotaged the economy. Additionally, Chinese sanctions have targeted large American businesses, slashing their profits. Much like the UK during Brexit, the US has suffered immensely due to isolationism.
Saudi Arabia finds its military aid reduced due to US policy of isolationism at an awful time. Militants in Yemen have spread their influence over the border and clashes have started in the south, which the corrupt and decadent military is unsuited to combat, despite military training by the US and superiority in equipment.
2026: Taiwan joins the Chinese as a special territory 
In a historical referendum, Taiwan opts to enter the fold of the People's Republic, finally completing reunification. With this monumental task completed, China looks to the west, toward the untamed lands of Central Asia and to the south, toward the turbulent waters of the South China Sea.
China asserts its political influence in South East Asia and Central Asia and finds allies in Myanmar, Laos and Australia while US influence wanes.
2027: TECH UPDATE
Python 9.0 finally gets full multithreading support. Maximum three threads.
Excel now supports HTML and CSS.
A brief foray into popularizing Access fails.
Over half of all websites still use PHP, though their owners think otherwise.
2028: Election Year
After years of economic downturn resulting from the incumbent's reckless policy decisions and misguided ideals, the youth of America rose up in huge demonstrations calling for the President's impeachment. This incredible display of resolve was supported by a few US multinationals whose businesses were threatened by current isolationist policies as well as European powers keen to see the US return to its previous position of power.
For the 2024 election, both sides enact a brutal war of influence over the internet, each side spreading propaganda and spewing hatred. Violence erupts periodically in the streets as the youthful progressives and elderly conservatives clash. Through the rubble, a new President emerges, narrowly defeating his rival. 
Implementing reforms to the education sector and fully socializing healthcare and dismantling the policy of isolationism (this was done when members of the House and Senate refused to participate in the government in a boycott/were refused entry to the government buildings by armed guards)(half of the Senate and House would have to be  reelected when a bill forcing politicians over the age of 70 do a (really hard) mental aptitude test (it was about complicated things like macroeconomics and being kind!!! we dont stand a chance!!! this isnt fair!!!))(34 bills were passed that day.) helped to fill up the US Treasury once again.
Aid would once again flow to the US' allies all over the world, including Ukraine, which was still fighting against Russia. Fleets returned to their duties all across the Pacific and South East Asia while ambassadors traveled the global to resume trade and repair relations. Slowly, the wounds healed. 
2029: Cracks appear in Russia.
Struck by disease and the ravages of age, Putin retreats from his office to nurse his illnesses. With their leader's death within sight, high ranking officials, influential oligarchs and mercenary leaders make preparations to take over the nation upon Putin's death. Some find support with China and Iran while others become proxies of the Europeans.
2030: In the Middle East, The veneer of peace that defined the prior era has been stripped away. Now, militants and rebels take to war, fighting fiercely in a deadly struggle for dominance. Government forces and dictatorial cults fight in a hopeless battle to maintain the status quo while rebels and insurrectionists steadily grow in power and strength as they strive for legitamacy and strength. One by one, the nations of the MIddle East find themselves embroiled in civil war. Syria and Iraq, as always, have been in a state of anarchy while the Taliban's control in Afghanistan has collapsed fully. The giants of the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Iran are struggling to fend off each others proxies in Yemen and Kurdistan respectively.  
2031: Daring Raid
Sensing weakness within Russia, the Ukrainians launch a daring raid into Russia in the middle of winter, capturing a large city and several towns with little resistance. Putin, still bedridden from his illness, orders Russian nuclear forces to high alert and demands the Ukrainians withdraw immediately.
As per protocol, upon reception of the presidential order nuclear siloes were armed, rocket forces mobilized and dispersed, and all submarines capable of battle sent out to the sea. All eyes are on Russia and Ukraine. Thousands of military personnel have also been withdrawn from the frontline and sent back home to defend the country proper.
Only a month later, Vladimir Putin dies from excessive stress. Though a provisional government quickly takes control, disagreements between the oligarchs and politicians, as well as rumors that the government wants to increase the age of retirement above their expected lifespan brought the country into total chaos. Rural provinces, having long given up Moscow's influence, send their letters of secession. In the streets of Moscow and St.Petersburg, riots have started. Anarchists and insurrectionists alike clash with government forces still loyal to the provisional government. The military has already splintered into multiple groups and mercenaries. 
As the situation in Russia gets worse and worse, the eyes finally turn not to the bloodied streets of Moscow, but to the armed nuclear warheads dispersed all over Russia. With each one capable of leveling cities and destroying armies, the country quickly turns to chaos as every organization, group, power and mercenary fight to obtain their own.
2032: Amid the flood of refugees entering Europe and concerns about live Russian nuclear weapons, the UN finally sends a task force to stabilize the situation and recover the nuclear devices. Though the pacification and stabilization of the Western and Far East regions proceed relatively smoothly, the UN are unable to bring the freezing cold territories in Siberia and the Central Plains to peace. Attempts to occupy the zone was met with a series of 'dirty bombs' extremely destructive and toxic nuclear weapons fashioned out of warheads. With vast swathes of territory irradiated, the UN considers the situation untenable and orders a retreat. The US, China and various European nations instead opt to launch raids to locate and destroy the dirty bombs one by one.
Provisional governments supported by the EU and USA are established in the west while a handful of states in the east align themselves with the Chinese. Towards Central Asia, Islamic militant groups and anarchist rebels have fortified themselves within the Urals and the Altai, arming themselves with a huge stock of Russian arms and armour, as well as whatever nukes the UN was unable to seize. A new age of Russian warlords have begun.
2033: Though both USA and China did work together to secure the Russian territories, misunderstandings between the two powers during the operation caused further division. A constant flow of hateful propaganda from both sides did nothing to reduce tensions.
2034: Some guy named Sergey Taboritsky takes control of the small Komi-Zyrian Oblast. He is shot dead upon taking office.
2035:
