Plot Relevance:
Though all parts of the story (with the exception of the prologue) occur on Elysia, Terra, and the various events that occur on its surface will impact the plot in various ways.

Historical Timeline:
2022: Russian Invasion of Ukraine. The Russians will devote immnense resources to this war, ultimately culminating in the dissolution of the Russian Federation.
2023: Gaza Crisis. This destabilizes the Middle East. (Timeline Divergence. This is where our plot will split for reality.)
2024: US President embraces isolationist ideals, reduces support for Ukraine and Isreal 
2025: Disney reveals Disney++, to international acclaim. Saudi Arabia experiences economic downturn as oil demand dries.
2026: Taiwan joins the Chinese. China asserts its political influence in South East Asia and Central Asia. US influence wanes.

2032: Provisional governments supported by the EU and USA are established in the west while a handful of states in the east align themselves with the Chinese. Towards Central Asia, Islamic militant groups and anarchist rebels have fortified themselves within the Urals and the Altai, arming themselves with a huge stock of Russian arms and armour, as well as whatever nukes the UN was unable to seize.

2034: Some guy named Sergey Taboritsky takes control of the small Komi-Zyrian Oblast. He is shot dead upon taking office.
...

2041: A US initative to cut off the flow of weapons from the russian territories in the north to the wars in the Middle East begins. 
2042: The US initiative fails. The conflict intensifies and spreads northward. China takes this opportunity to weaken US resolve.

Important Notes: (Historical Timeline)
The US 9th Fleet is battling the Chinese PLAN near Malaysia when the nukes begin to fall. It is ordered to retreat to the naval base in Singapore. An Ohio-Class SSBN is part of this contingent.
Singapore experiences a refugee crisis. Its population swells from 6 million to 7.5 million. Martial law is enacted while strict food and electricity rationing occurs.

Technology:
The Terrans have attained a very high level of technology, with a level of sophistication and power similar to that of the Ravernals.
Magic is completely absent from terran technology. The humans on Terra have not encountered any form of magic whatsoever on Earth and as a result did not develop magitech.
The development of Terran technology took a relatively short amount of time, with exponential improvement over a mere hundred-and-fifty years. During this period, a staggering number of inventions and discoveries were made over a wide array of specialties.

Character Relevance:
Manson: Gets transported by the big red ball.
