todo: prettify this mess.

Plot Relevance:
Though all parts of the story (with the exception of the prologue) occur on Elysia, Terra, and the various events that occur on its surface will impact the plot in various ways.

Historical Timeline: (all of these are fictional. Any resemblance to real life or historical events are coincidental.)
2022: Russian Invasion of Ukraine. 
Despite initial setbacks, the Ukrainians successfully manage to push the Russians back and achieve a stalemate. Russia will devote immense resources to this war, pouring massive amounts of money and men in attempt after fruitless attempt to retake the initiative and end the war once and for all.
2023: Gaza Crisis. 
the Middle East becomes unstable once again after a short period of relative peace. Hamas militants attack Isreal in an all-out war. Isreal responds with relentless force, blockading the Gaza Strip, bombing the militants and arresting droves of Palestinians. Each side trades accusations of warcrimes and human rights violations. In the wider region, insurrectionists and militants rise up in support for Hamas' fight against Isreal and the West, launching attacks against assets linked to Isreal, including cargo ships.
The United States forms a coalition to protect global shipping near the Horn of Africa, shooting down missiles launched by militants.
Later on, the US becomes frustrated at Isreal's heavy-handed approach to dealing with Hamas, complaining about excess casualties. When Isreal refused to back down and placed even more pressure on innocent Palestinians instead, the US withdraws much of its military aid for Isreal.
Russia finally realises that it cannot gain anything from fighting in the war. Therefore, it opts to fight using alternative means.
To undermine the credibility of its opponent, Russia leverages its army of bots and trolls and a sophisticated network of influencers and agents to thoroughly saturate the internet with propaganda. Constant reminders of the West's previous follies fill social media while forums and blogs become indunated with praise for Putin. All over Youtube and Reddit, talking heads curse and swear at the incumbents, pointing at minor errors and mistakes to justify their shaky narratives while espousing the opposition for supporting vague and backward ideals. In the halls of the European Union, Russian supporters stall and veto every piece of legislature, slowing bureaucracy to a grinding halt. With such varied and far-reaching attacks on the West, their resolve crumbles. 
2024: During the 2024 Elections, thanks to Russian propaganda, the opposition wins and a radical president is elected. He immediately brings in a slew of isolationist policies, cutting America off from the outside world. He also withdraws all support for Isreal and Ukraine and reverses many of the efforts made by the previous administration. 
2025: The US' economy is heavily reliant on exporting and importing goods from all around the world. The administration's isolationist policies have sabotaged the economy. Additionally, Chinese sanctions have targeted large American businesses, slashing their profits. Much like the UK during Brexit, the US has suffered immensely due to isolationism.
Saudi Arabia finds its military aid reduced due to US policy of isolationism at an awful time. Militants in Yemen have spread their influence over the border and clashes have started in the south, which the corrupt and decadent military is unsuited to combat, despite military training by the US and superiority in equipment.
2026: Taiwan joins the Chinese as a special territory 
In a historical referendum, Taiwan opts to enter the fold of the People's Republic, finally completing reunification. With this monumental task completed, China looks to the west, toward the untamed lands of Central Asia and to the south, toward the turbulent waters of the South China Sea.
China asserts its political influence in South East Asia and Central Asia and finds allies in Myanmar, Laos and Australia while US influence wanes.
2027: TECH UPDATE
Python 9.0 finally gets full multithreading support. Maximum three threads.
Excel now supports HTML and CSS.
A brief foray into popularizing Access fails.
Over half of all websites still use PHP, though their owners think otherwise.
2028: Election Year
After years of economic downturn resulting from the incumbent's reckless policy decisions and misguided ideals, the youth of America rose up in huge demonstrations calling for the President's impeachment. This incredible display of resolve was supported by a few US multinationals whose businesses were threatened by current isolationist policies as well as European powers keen to see the US return to its previous position of power.
For the 2024 election, both sides enact a brutal war of influence over the internet, each side spreading propaganda and spewing hatred. Violence erupts periodically in the streets as the youthful progressives and elderly conservatives clash. Through the rubble, a new President emerges, narrowly defeating his rival. 
Implementing reforms to the education sector and fully socializing healthcare and dismantling the policy of isolationism (this was done when members of the House and Senate refused to participate in the government in a boycott/were refused entry to the government buildings by armed guards)(half of the Senate and House would have to be  reelected when a bill forcing politicians over the age of 70 do a (really hard) mental aptitude test (it was about complicated things like macroeconomics and being kind!!! we dont stand a chance!!! this isnt fair!!!))(104 bills were passed that day.) helped to fill up the US Treasury once again.
Aid would once again flow to the US' allies all over the world, including Ukraine, which was still fighting against Russia. Fleets returned to their duties all across the Pacific and South East Asia while ambassadors traveled the global to resume trade and repair relations. Slowly, the wounds healed. 
2029: Secessionist Movements occur in Russia.
Years of war and sanctions have taken their toll on the economy of Russia. Cut off from the outside world, the people have had to endure shortages of consumer goods and job losses from factories shutting down. Furthermore, foreign influence originating from the US, the Europeans and even its allies China and Iran have allowed insurrectionists to take root. The rebels have the greatest influence in the rural areas where government control has waned and the people are most unhappy due to mobilization and unemployment.
2030: Beginning in Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Second Arab Spring occurs, with various militants supported by China and USA respectively.
2031/10: The Ukrainians capture some land within Russia. Putin bring nuclear forces to high alert.
2031/12: The Russian Federation collapses entirely after a failed coup following the death of Putin. (his successor changes retirement age, causing many Russians to flood onto the streets.) Militants seize control of vast swathes of territory and arms.
2032/2: Amid the flood of refugees entering Europe and concerns about live Russian nuclear weapons, the UN finally sends a task force to stabilize the situation and recover the nuclear devices.
2032: Provisional governments supported by the EU and USA are established in the west while a handful of states in the east align themselves with the Chinese. Towards Central Asia, Islamic militant groups and anarchist rebels have fortified themselves within the Urals and the Altai, arming themselves with a huge stock of Russian arms and armour, as well as whatever nukes the UN was unable to seize.
2033: A second cold war brews between the USA and China.
2034: Some guy named Sergey Taboritsky takes control of the small Komi-Zyrian Oblast. He is shot dead upon taking office.
...
2040: The cold war becomes hot. Mild confrontations in the South China Sea and the Middle East gradually escalate to direct skirmishes. Proxies become more hostile and begin directly attacking USA and China.
2041: A US initative to cut off the flow of weapons from the russian territories in the north to the wars in the Middle East begins. 
2042: The US initiative fails. The conflict intensifies and spreads northward. China takes this opportunity to weaken US resolve.
2043: Naval skirmishes occur in South East Asia as China asserts its influence.
2044: Full scale war breaks out between the USA and China.
2045: Nuclear exchange between the USA and China. The end of the world occurs.




Technology:
The Terrans have attained a very high level of technology, with a level of sophistication and power similar to that of the Ravernals.
Magic is completely absent from terran technology. The humans on Terra have not encountered any form of magic whatsoever on Earth and as a result did not develop magitech.
The development of Terran technology took a relatively short amount of time, with exponential improvement over a mere hundred-and-fifty years. During this period, a staggering number of inventions and discoveries were made over a wide array of specialties.
