Timeline (early alpha, unstable build, i am not liable for any damages, incidents or whatever legal things because this is pure cope and fiction, pls no arrest me)

This Timeline includes the following plot points:
    The fall of the Unipolar World Order
        USA falls from grace and loses its position as the premiere world power on the global stage. China, various European nations (EU) and even Iran will take over USA's place.
    The fall of the Rules-based World Order
        Nations can use a variety of methods to manipulate their opponent's population to act on their behalf. With such powerful tools of covert influence, even regional powers like Iran can become above the law.
    World War Three
        China and the USA eventually clashing. 
        The Second Cold War, with all the proxy battles are simply a lead-up to all of this. Yes, twenty years was indeed needed to ignite a war between to global powers.
    Singapore getting Nuked
        An Ohio-Class SSBN, despite being wounded, still presents a credible threat to ANY nuclear force. Hypersonics were used to deliver the deadly nuclear payload.
    Putin Getting What He Deserves (Optional)
        Just a personal one from the author. What's there to love about an ex-KGB agent and his oligarch cronies?

2022: Russian Invasion of Ukraine. 
    Despite initial setbacks, the Ukrainians successfully manage to push the Russians back and achieve a stalemate. Russia will devote immense resources to this war, pouring massive amounts of money and men in attempt after fruitless attempt to retake the initiative and end the war once and for all.
2023: Gaza Crisis and the Russian Realization
    the Middle East becomes unstable once again after a short period of relative peace. Hamas militants attack Isreal in an all-out war. Isreal responds with relentless force, blockading the Gaza Strip, bombing the militants and arresting droves of Palestinians. Each side trades accusations of warcrimes and human rights violations. In the wider region, insurrectionists and militants rise up in support for Hamas' fight against Isreal and the West, launching attacks against assets linked to Isreal, including cargo ships.
    The United States forms a coalition to protect global shipping near the Horn of Africa, shooting down missiles launched by militants.
    Later on, the US becomes frustrated at Isreal's heavy-handed approach to dealing with Hamas, complaining about excess casualties. When Isreal refused to back down and placed even more pressure on innocent Palestinians instead, the US withdraws much of its military aid for Isreal.
    Russia finally realises that it cannot gain anything from fighting in the war. Therefore, it opts to gain an advantage through alternative means.
    To undermine the credibility of its opponent, Russia leverages its army of bots and trolls, a sophisticated network of influencers and agents as well as allies all over the world to thoroughly saturate the internet with propaganda. Constant reminders of the West's previous follies fill social media while forums and blogs become indunated with praise for Putin. All over Youtube and Reddit, talking heads curse and swear at the incumbents, pointing at minor errors and mistakes to justify their shaky narratives while espousing the opposition for supporting vague and backward ideals. In the halls of the European Union, Russian supporters stall and veto every piece of legislature, slowing bureaucracy to a grinding halt. These varied and far reaching attacks successfully manipulate the US elections and sabotage the Eu from within.
2024: Election Year
    During the 2024 Elections, thanks to Russian propaganda, the opposition wins and a radical    president is elected. He immediately brings in a slew of isolationist policies, cutting America off from the outside world. He also withdraws all support for Isreal and Ukraine and reverses many of the efforts made by the previous administration. 
2025: The West has fallen, billions must isolate
    The US' economy is heavily reliant on exporting and importing goods from all around the world. The administration's isolationist policies have sabotaged the economy. Additionally, Chinese sanctions have targeted large American businesses, slashing their profits. Much like the UK during Brexit, the US has suffered immensely due to isolationism.
    Saudi Arabia finds its military aid reduced due to US policy of isolationism at an awful time. Militants in Yemen have spread their influence over the border and clashes have started in the south, which the corrupt and decadent military is unsuited to combat, despite military training by the US and superiority in equipment.
2026: Taiwan joins the Chinese as a special territory 
    In a historical referendum, Taiwan opts to enter the fold of the People's Republic, finally completing reunification. With this monumental task completed, China looks to the west, toward the untamed lands of Central Asia and to the south, toward the turbulent waters of the South China Sea.
    China asserts its political influence in South East Asia and Central Asia and finds allies in Myanmar, Laos and Australia while US influence wanes.
2027: TECH UPDATE
    Python 9.0 finally gets full multithreading support. Maximum three threads.
    Excel now supports HTML and CSS.
    A brief foray into popularizing Access fails.
    Over half of all websites still use PHP, though their owners think otherwise.
    Edge somehow gets popular.
2028: The American Miracle
    After years of economic downturn resulting from the incumbent's reckless policy decisions and misguided ideals, the youth of America rose up in huge demonstrations calling for the President's impeachment. This incredible display of resolve was supported by a few US multinationals whose businesses were threatened by current isolationist policies as well as European powers keen to see the US return to its previous position of power.
    For the 2024 election, both sides enact a brutal war of influence over the internet, each side spreading propaganda and spewing hatred. Violence erupts periodically in the streets as the youthful progressives and elderly conservatives clash. Through the rubble, a new President emerges, narrowly defeating his rival. 
    Implementing reforms to the education sector and fully socializing healthcare and dismantling the policy of isolationism (this was done when members of the House and Senate refused to participate in the government in a boycott/were refused entry to the government buildings by armed guards)(half of the Senate and House would have to be  reelected when a bill forcing politicians over the age of 70 do a (really hard) mental aptitude test (it was about complicated things like macroeconomics and being kind!!! we dont stand a chance!!! this isnt fair!!!))(34 bills were passed that day.) helped to fill up the US Treasury once again.
    Aid would once again flow to the US' allies all over the world, including Ukraine, which was still fighting against Russia. Fleets returned to their duties all across the Pacific and South East Asia while ambassadors traveled the global to resume trade and repair relations. Slowly, the wounds healed. 
2029: Cracks appear in Russia.
    Struck by disease and the ravages of age, Putin retreats from his office to nurse his illnesses. With their leader's death within sight, high ranking officials, influential oligarchs and mercenary leaders make preparations to take over the nation upon Putin's death. Some find support with China and Iran while others become proxies of the Europeans.
2030: Warlord Era in the Sandbox
    In the Middle East, The veneer of peace that defined the prior era has been stripped away. Now, militants and rebels take to war, fighting fiercely in a deadly struggle for dominance. Government forces and dictatorial cults fight in a hopeless battle to maintain the status quo while rebels and insurrectionists steadily grow in power and strength as they strive for legitamacy and strength. One by one, the nations of the MIddle East find themselves embroiled in civil war. Syria and Iraq, as always, have been in a state of anarchy while the Taliban's control in Afghanistan has collapsed fully. The giants of the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Iran are struggling to fend off each others proxies in Yemen and Kurdistan respectively.  
2031: Daring Raid
    Sensing weakness within Russia, the Ukrainians launch a daring raid into Russia in the middle of winter, capturing a large city and several towns with little resistance. Putin, still bedridden from his illness, orders Russian nuclear forces to high alert and demands the Ukrainians withdraw immediately.
    As per protocol, upon reception of the presidential order nuclear siloes were armed, rocket forces mobilized and dispersed, and all submarines capable of battle sent out to the sea. All eyes are on Russia and Ukraine. Thousands of military personnel have also been withdrawn from the frontline and sent back home to defend the country proper.
    Only a month later, Vladimir Putin dies from excessive stress. Though a provisional government quickly takes control, disagreements between the oligarchs and politicians, as well as rumors that the government wants to increase the age of retirement above their expected lifespan brought the country into total chaos. Rural provinces, having long given up Moscow's influence, send their letters of secession. In the streets of Moscow and St.Petersburg, riots have started. Anarchists and insurrectionists alike clash with government forces still loyal to the provisional government. The military has already splintered into multiple groups and mercenaries. 
    As the situation in Russia gets worse and worse, the eyes finally turn not to the bloodied streets of Moscow, but to the armed nuclear warheads dispersed all over Russia. With each one capable of leveling cities and destroying armies, the country quickly turns to chaos as every organization, group, power and mercenary fight to obtain their own.
2032: Special Operation Into Russia
    Amid the flood of refugees entering Europe and concerns about live Russian nuclear weapons, the UN finally sends a task force to stabilize the situation and recover the nuclear devices. Though the pacification and stabilization of the Western and Far East regions proceed relatively smoothly, the UN are unable to bring the freezing cold territories in Siberia and the Central Plains to peace. Attempts to occupy the zone was met with a series of 'dirty bombs' extremely destructive and toxic nuclear weapons fashioned out of warheads. With vast swathes of territory irradiated, the UN considers the situation untenable and orders a retreat. The US, China and various European nations instead opt to launch raids to locate and destroy the dirty bombs one by one.
    Provisional governments supported by the EU and USA are established in the west while a handful of states in the east align themselves with the Chinese. Towards Central Asia, Islamic militant groups and anarchist rebels have fortified themselves within the Urals and the Altai, arming themselves with a huge stock of Russian arms and armour, as well as whatever nukes the UN was unable to seize. A new age of Russian warlords have begun.
2033: Start of the Second Cold War
    Though both USA and China did work together to secure the Russian territories, misunderstandings between the two powers during the operation caused further division. A constant flow of hateful propaganda from both sides did nothing to reduce tensions.
2034: Extras
    Some guy named Sergey Taboritsky takes control of the small Komi-Zyrian Oblast. He is shot dead upon taking office.
    The new democratic republics around Moscow have often been called Reichskommisariat Moskowien in various memes. 
2035: Review of the World-At-Large
    Second Cold War: 
    Tensions between USA and China is high. The Chinese fleets stare down US carrier groups in the South China Sea and off Taiwan. Bath sides also support proxies to gain an advantage over each other. These proxies operate in the warlord regions in Russia, parts of Central Asia and all around the MIddle East.
    The Russian Warlord Regions: 
    Might makes Right is the motto of the land. Armed with Russian Army equipment, donated arms from their supporters and 3D-printed weapons, the armies that fight here are strong and formidable, despite the difficult climate. Due to the proliferation of nuclear warheads, the warlords rarely fight one another, ensuring a fragile but tangible peace.
    The Middle East:
    The geopolitical landscape of the Middle East is dynamic and constantly evolving. Alliances are formed and destroyed, rebellions are created and quelled, external influence waxes and wanes, territory shifts back and forth, with bouts of violence intersparsing brief periods of peace. With tensions still running hot, historical grievances unresolved, external intervention unfinished, it is unlikely the conflict here will ever end.
    There is a high demand for weapons here. Arms flow uninterrupted from the warlord regions up north, perpetuating the conflict.
2036: Nuclear Arms Race
    What started as a small build-up of nuclear weapons by the neutral Pakistan and India quickly devolved into a protracted arms race by nearly every nuclear-armed nation on the planet to build nukes in greater quantity and quality.
    When India started testing their submarine-launched ballistic missiles in response to Pakistani posturing, China's attention suddenly became focused on the increasing capabilities of its neighbour. Fearing that Indian nukes could be turned on them as easily as they were against Pakistan, China embarked on a comprehensive nuclearizaton program to equip its conventional forces, especially its navy, with nuclear delivery capabilities.
    Of course, the US interpreted this move as a hostile action and rushed to react. More funding was poured into revitalizing the nuclear triad, with increased production of new hypersonic missiles, preparation of various airbases in the Pacific to recieve nuclear-capable heavy stealth bombers and finally research into a new fleet of nuclear submarines.
2037: Concern over Biohazards
    A scandal revealed that the US was secretly developing bioweapons. Raids by US police uncovered the synthesis of deadly viruses and contagious bacteria. Some microbes were even bred to produce anthrax, a deadly poison that is fatal to the touch. However, leaked documents show that many parts of the illegal research was based of similar classified findings from China, leading many to believe that the Chinese did the illegal stuff first.
    Chinese officials vehemently deny this claim, asserting that the documents were fakes.
    Despite all the finger-pointing, it cannot be denied that the capability to produce deadly diseases has been attained by humanity. Man-made pandemics capable of wiping out nations have the potential to become real.
2038: Housing Prices Collapse (About Time!)
    After years of speculative and unsustainable increases in housing prices, the housing markets in both China and the USA collapse at the same time. Inital jubiliation about the decrease in property prices quickly fades as a recession sets in. 
    For China, the decades of relentless growth that many had taken for granted has finally been halted and is replaced by the looming shadow of recession. However, the government's refusal to act until the last moment caused the fall of many large corprations and cast doubt upon the ability of the Chinese economy to bounce back from the crisis.
    The Americans were no better either. Their flawed, stagnant economy was already struggling and the recent recession only served to send the economy on a downward death spiral. Total bankruptcy was only avoided with massive government bailouts.
    Though the worldwide recession caused people on both sides to suffer from rampant inflation and dissolution of their bank accounts, many still took the opportunity to fling mud and blame the other side for the crisis.

2040: filler
2041: idea: pain and suffering!
2042: idea: GWOT 2.0 but it will be more successful this time because no nation-building (utter fail)
2043: todo
2044: Non-state actors release a deadly disease in the US, where is quickly spreads all over the busy metropolitan areas. After a short incubation period, the virus will quickly take over the affected individual, causing a slow, painful and ultimately fatal death. Understandably, many enraged Americans have viewed this as an attack on US soil itself, comparable to the tragic Pearl Harbour or 9/11 attacks.
Blinded by rage, most were quick to blame the Chinese government for this senseless tragedy for inital investigations revealed that the first carrier of the disease was a Chinese national orginating from China. Having concluded that the Chinese have orchestrated a deadly attack on the US, various military forces throughout the globe quickly mobilize and bring up arms against China.
Four Carrier Strike Groups sail into Chinese territorial waters in a show of force, ignoring orders to the contary while aircraft fully loaded with armanent buzz around the coasts of Asia.

    The keys are turned, nuclear missiles are launched.
    Ancient Minutemen IIIs join their younger hypersonic cousins as they travel to the Orient.
    Chinese nuclear submarines launch salvoes of nukes at US cities.
    India and Pakistan exchange nukes.
    The Vietnamese border is breached.
    The two Koreas slug it out with massed artillery and armour.

    All is quiet.

    "They will struggle for the sake of struggle. They will struggle, in other words, out of a certain boredom: for they cannot imagine living in a world without struggle."

Timeline/Periods
    Russian Invasion of Ukraine.
        Justification:
            None needed, real-life event.
        Actions:
            Despite initial setbacks, the Ukrainians successfully manage to push the Russians back and achieve a stalemate.
            The frontline will not shift for years despite extensive efforts from both sides to break the stalemate and regain initiative.
        Effects:
            Russia's invasion was viewed as an imperialist act by other nations. Hence the Russian Federation was struck by international sanctions which impacted the Russian economy, the ruble and many governmrnt mechanisms. Only the quick and decisive actions of treasury officials stalled the Ruble's downward spiral, preventing a major recession.
            Russia devotes a large amount of resources to fighting in the war. Most of it pre-war ammunition and reserve equipment are spent, forcing Russia to enter a war economy state and mass-produce things for the military. This has allowed Russia to maintain the initiative on the battleground. However, pouring money and state resources into the arms industry has left the civilian sectors floundering.
            Russia will look towards its allies for assistance. Iran offers large amounts of kamikaze drones used to great effect in Ukraine. It is also theorized that Iran influenced its proxy, Hamas, to invade Israel to draw Western attention away from Ukraine.
            North Korea trades technology for vast amounts of ammunition. Despite widespread complaints that Korean shells are of lackluster quality, they are still instrumental in keeping Russian stockpiles filled and maintaining artillery fire superiority.
            China offers to trade with Russi and even offers to help bypass sanctions by acting as an intermediary. Knowing that Russia has no one else to trade its vast energy and agriculture exports to, China demands deep discounts and steep markups from its ally.
