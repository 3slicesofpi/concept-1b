todo: prettify this mess

Overview:
Orthodox magic, an integral part of this world, adheres rigorously to a structured set of principles governing its existence, utilization, and limitations.
Magic often revolves around the capture, storage and usage of a powerful energy source, mana.

Foundation:
    Properties of Mana:
    Mana has an exceedingly low, if not zero mass. However, it has a high energy state and can experience velocity and spin.
    Mana will be repelled from each other. This effect increases in magnitude at a exponential rate but is not significant at low and medium mana concentrations. This effect only becomes a concern in military and industrial applications such as shield generators and fast crystal growth.
    Mana will be attracted towards areas where mana is being spent (a manaic event). This effect increases in magnitude at a logarithmic rate. It is significant at low usage rates but does not increase much after that.
    The movement of mana is also affected by magnetic forces.

    Sources of Mana:
    Mana is produced at the edge of the world, (at the outermost edge of the world's gellar field.) where mana and its opposite counterpart, arcana, are produced. Under normal circumstances, mana and arcana will annhilate each other but the edge seperates the two energies, allowing mana to continue existing in reality while arcana can persist in the chaotic Void.
    However, mana is extremely unstable, so it must be 'contained.' Fortunately, the edge (the gellar field) creates a protective 'bubble' around the mana that prevents the mana from decomposing, forming a manacule.
    Manacules will gradually move towards the world of Elysia, as it is attracted to the various manaic events occuring there.

    Using Mana:
    Catalysts use mana in order to do work. However, the mana found in the surroundings are found in manacules and cannot be directly used as is. This is because the formation of the virtual conduits are random, disorderly and complicated.
    Typically, manacules are collected from the environment. They have to undergo a complicated process to remove the protective 'bubble'. 
    To prevent the mana from decomposing the instant it is removed from its manacule, it is kept inside an isolated environment, typically within a soild metal with a maginetic field where mana can flow. Alternatively, it can bond to metals in a process called enrichment.
    Catalysts are materials that will use mana to do work. They come in different shapes and sizes.

    Magic formations:
    A simple magic formation consists of source(s) of mana, conduits and catalyst(s) arranged in a specific pattern for the efficient and safe flow of mana through conduits.
    Some catalysts also require special conditions to be met before they can function properly.
    Functional, efficient and safe magic formations are the backbone of any magic-based civilisation.
