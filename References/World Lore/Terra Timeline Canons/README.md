Regarding the timeline of Earth/Terra prior to the Transfer Event, there is no true canon.

Geopolitics is hard. Predicting the events of the future is challenging, considering how the Earth is filled with many different cultures and nations, all of which have differing needs and interests and act according to a various principles and limitations. Shaping the world order to fit the plot while being both accurate and nuanced is nigh impossible.
Additionally, readers may disagree with the views of the author(s), causing unneeded conterversy, creating pointless arguments and forming hatred. (read as: author doesnt want to get into flame war between commies and fascists)

Instead, a system of multicanons is in place, where every possible timeline written is considered canon, and are all equally true. Everyone and anyone can create their own timeline and it will be accepted as long as they satisfy the following requirements:

|No.|Requirement|
|-|-|
|1.|End at the year 2045 and span at least 20 years.|
|2.|Set up war between the USA and China. Cold War/Proxy Conflict is ideal.|
|3.|Illustrate the breakdown of the Unipolar/Rules-based World Order|

Subject to change. Older timelines using old requirements may be grandfathered in if this list is updated.

Requirements last updated in Feb 2024
