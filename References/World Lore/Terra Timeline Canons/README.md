# README before continuing.


Regarding the timeline of Earth/Terra prior to the Transfer Event, there is no true canon.

Instead, there is a system of multicanons, where every acceptable timeline will be considered true and canon. Each timeline will have to fulfill a series of 'plug-and-play' requirements to ensure it is compatiable with the rest of the plot.

You can create your own timeline and show how actions and events can come together to spark a world-ending conflict. The timeline will be accepted into the multicanon if it satisfies the following requirements. 

|No.|Requirement|
|-|-|
|1.|End at the year 2045 and span at least 20 years.|
|2.|Set up war between the USA and China. Cold War/Proxy Conflict is ideal.|
|3.|Illustrate the breakdown of the Unipolar/Rules-based World Order|

Subject to change. Older timelines using old requirements may be grandfathered in if this list is updated.

Requirements last updated in Feb 2024

You may add in your own unique twist when writing your timeline. Insert dubious geopolitical takes, extreme ideological tendencies, hair-raising genocidal horror or even literal smut. You could even add in hope and happiness and lovable side characters frolicking around in vibrant green meadows. (but be warned: everything dies in a few short years.)

However, submitted timelines that include extremist content and vulgar material that conflict with the Terms of Service of Git/Github will not be showcased here.
