## Preceding Events:

### Escalation

Tensions between the USA and China are at an all-time high. Aircraft routinely fly past each other's coasts and cities, filling the sky with otherworldy shrieks and booms. Warships have replaced the once-ubiquitous cargo vessel in plying the waters of the Pacific, their crewmen staring down the opposing side as they sail past. Diplomatic meetings meant to maintain the peace always collapse into a seething riot, complete with brawling politicians and gnarly fistfights.

In both the USA and China, the people are up in arms. Force fed a constant stream of wartime propaganda and misinformation, they vehemently support the efforts of their country and their allies to resist the enemy while encouraging more conflict and violence. On the other side of the metaphorical political aisle, some have come to oppose their own countrymen, taking the stance of the enemy. Though some simply call for peace and love, many actively denounce the actions of their own nation, both in the present and from the annals of history, and predict the imminent economic collapse or inevitable military defeat of their own country.
