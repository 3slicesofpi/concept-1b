## Introduction:

This document details the events that happened on the planet of Earth 1 year before the nation-state of Singapore was transported to the world of Elysia. Such events will impact the plot in various ways such as national spirits, character personalities and internal politics as well as determine the extent of resources, assets and liabilities the state and the people have at their disposal.

## Preceding Events:

### Escalation

Tensions between the USA and China are at an all-time high. Aircraft routinely fly past each other's coasts and cities, filling the sky with otherworldy shrieks and booms. Warships have replaced the once-ubiquitous cargo vessel in plying the waters of the Pacific, their crewmen staring down the opposing side as they sail past. Diplomatic meetings meant to maintain the peace always collapse into a seething riot, complete with brawling politicians and gnarly fistfights.

In both the USA and China, the people are up in arms. Force fed a constant stream of wartime propaganda and misinformation, they vehemently support the efforts of their country and their allies to resist the enemy while encouraging more conflict and violence. On the other side of the metaphorical political aisle, some have come to oppose their own countrymen and resist the call to arms, viewed to be taking the stance of the enemy. Though some simply call for peace and love, many actively denounce the actions of their own nation, both in the present and from the annals of history, and predict the imminent economic collapse or inevitable military defeat of their own country.

Their respective economies have been prepped for war. The factories are alive again, producing crude but essential war material. Sophisticated machines of war and destruction roll off bustling assembly lines by the hundred. Shipyards work all day and night to bring in the newest, most modern vessels to the fore, though older ships enjoy a modernization kit every now and then, keeping them in trend.

The recuitment offices are filled, their halls populated by eager volunteers and, increasingly often, reluctant draftees. Accountants and logisticians have been displaced from their comfortable offices, their attention directed towards managing the relentless military buildup. Lassoed in by their respective governments, data engineers and programmers work day and night to build killer robot AI for autonomous military drones.

Their allies experienced a similar buildup in forces as well. Military bases were expanded to accomodate a permanent foreign military presence while patrolling battlefleets fill their congested ports. The shriek and boom of military exercises, weapons tests and enemy aggression fill the air, ensuring that the common people never have a moment of silence.

Non-aligned nations, despite their best efforts, are often caught in the crossfire. The two superpowers engage in proxy conflict, using the desert wastes of the Middle East and North Africa, the dark jungles of Central Africa and South America and the harsh mountain ranges of the Himalyans and in Afghanistan as massive battlegrounds for strategic superiority.

Neutral Countries also find themselves in a constant tug-of-war from both sides, with each side seeking to gain their allegiance and build up ever more resources and power for themselves. Some nations choose to distance themselves from the great power conflict as much as possible, turning inward or confiding in other non-aligned nations. Others, such as Singapore, choose to carefully balance the competing influence of both sides, profiting at every step of the process. However, the risk of mismanaging the two sides' demands carries extreme risk
